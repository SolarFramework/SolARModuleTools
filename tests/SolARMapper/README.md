SolAR test mapper
=============

This test creates two mappers that includes storage components in *Singleton* mode (e.g. point cloud manager, keyframe manager, covisibility graph, keyframe retriever). 
Therefore, Only one instance of each component is created and two mappers share the same storage components.
